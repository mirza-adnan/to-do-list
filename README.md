# To-Do List  
A simple to-do list app which lets you create new projects and add tasks to respective projects made using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**. To be honest, I'm not really content with the end result. I had a mental breakdown while working on this and I didn't really bother to make things efficient and good looking. I was lousy with naming stuff as well. I really believe I could have done a lot better and implemented more things. Oh well. I'll definitely re-do this project sometime in the future.

## Things I learned
- localStorage doesn't store object types. So you have to recreate the objects using Object.assign
- Be more efficient with class names. I made a mess with classnames in this project
- The Single Responsibility Principle. Even though the code is messy I tried to implement this as much as possible.
