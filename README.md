# To-Do List  
A simple to-do list app which lets you create new projects and add tasks to respective projects made using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**.  

## [Live](https://mirza-adnan.github.io/to-do-list/)  

## Functionality
- You can create multiple projects which contain their separate list of tasks
- The default project is "Inbox"
- You can add as many tasks as you want under any of your projects  

## Tools I used
- Basic HTML, CSS, JS
- Webpack
- ESLint
- Export Imports and JS classes  

## Things I learned
- localStorage doesn't store object types. So you have to recreate the objects using Object.assign
- Be more efficient with class names. I made a mess with classnames in this project
- The Single Responsibility Principle. Even though the code is messy I tried to implement this as much as possible.
